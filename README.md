# Insomnia

Insomnia will remind you to take a rest and that you can always come back to the work tomorrow.
Inspired by http://sleepyti.me a website that calculates optimal times to fall asleep based on when you want to wake up.
The idea is that when you wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle you will feel groggy, however if you wakeup during the
transition between sleep cycles you will feel refreshed! This application uses the averages that sleep cycles are 90 minutes each
and a person takes 15 minutes to fall asleep from when they begin to try and calculates the times for you to sleep.
It will notify you throughout the night when the optimal times to shutdown your computer and start to head to sleep and provide a button to do just that.
This application works well with https://justgetflux.com/
